## Summary

I wanted to create this project to expand my knowledge of operators and event listeners. When the user inputs a value, it is looped through the `DOM` , saved as a value and displayed on the screen. The operators process the request through a `switch` and the total return value is displayed. This project has taught me to be efficient with the use of `forEach` loop.
